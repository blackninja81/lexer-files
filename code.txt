    /*** Definition Section has one variable... ***/:
        This is a comment block indicating that it's the definition section of the Flex file.
        %{ and %} delimit C code that will be included in the generated lexer code.
        In this section, you include the standard I/O library (#include <stdio.h>) to use printf for output later in the program.
        You declare an integer variable count, which is currently not used in this updated code.

    /*** Rule Section has three rules ***/:
        This is another comment block indicating the rule section of the Flex file.
        %% delimits the start and end of the rule section.

    [A-Za-z]+ { printf("%s\n", yytext); }:
        This rule matches sequences of one or more uppercase or lowercase letters (words) and prints them.
        [A-Za-z]+ is a regular expression that matches alphabetic characters.
        { printf("%s\n", yytext); } is the action associated with this rule. It prints the matched word using printf and adds a newline to separate words.

    .:
        This rule matches any single character except a newline.
        Since there is no action specified, it effectively ignores these characters.

    \n:
        This rule matches newline characters.
        Similar to the previous rule, there is no action specified, so it ignores newlines.

    /*** Code Section ***/:
        This comment block indicates the code section of the Flex file.

    int main() {:
        This is the beginning of the main function in C.

    printf("Enter an English sentence (press Enter to tokenize):\n");:
        This line prints a message prompting the user to enter English sentences.

    while (1) {:
        This starts an infinite loop, allowing the program to tokenize multiple sentences.

    char sentence[1000];:
        This line declares a character array sentence with a size of 1000 characters to store input sentences.

    if (fgets(sentence, sizeof(sentence), stdin) == NULL) {:
        This line reads a line of input from the user (stdin) and stores it in the sentence array.
        The fgets function reads up to sizeof(sentence) characters or until a newline is encountered.
        If it reaches the end of the input (EOF), the loop breaks.

    yy_scan_string(sentence);:
        This line prepares Flex to scan the current sentence stored in the sentence array.
        It sets up the input buffer for Flex to tokenize.

    int token;:
        This declares an integer variable token to store the tokens generated by Flex.

    while ((token = yylex()) != 0) {:
        This loop processes the tokens generated by the Flex lexer.
        It continues until it reaches the end of the input (token 0).

    if (token == '\n') { printf("\n"); }:
        This checks if the token is a newline character.
        If it is, it prints a newline to separate sentences.

    return 0;:
        This exits the main function and the program.
